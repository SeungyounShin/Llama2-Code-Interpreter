# Llama2 Code Interpreter

This project allows LLM to generate code, execute it, receive feedback, debug, and answer questions based on the whole process. It is designed to be intuitive and versatile, capable of dealing with multiple languages and frameworks.

[The purpose and direction of the project](https://github.com/SeungyounShin/Llama2-Code-Interpreter/wiki)

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

- [x] ðŸš€ **Code Generation and Execution**: Llama2 is capable of generating code, which it then automatically identifies and executes within its generated code blocks.
- [x] Monitors and retains Python variables that were used in previously executed code blocks.
- [ ] ðŸŒŸ At the moment, my focus is on "Data development for GPT-4 code interpretation" and "Enhancing the model using this data". For more details, check out the [feat/finetuning branch](https://github.com/SeungyounShin/Llama2-Code-Interpreter/tree/feat/finetuning) in our repository.
- [x] ðŸŒŸ CodeLlama Support [CodeLlama2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/codellama)

***Llama2 in Action***

In the GIF, Llama2 is seen in action. A user types in the request: `Plot Nvidia 90 days chart.` Llama2, an advanced code interpreter fine-tuned on a select dataset, swiftly queries `Yahoo Finance`. Moments later, it fetches the latest Nvidia stock prices from the past 90 days. Using `Matplotlib`, Llama2 then generates a clear and detailed stock price chart for Nvidia, showcasing its performance over the given period.



## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SeungyounShin/Llama2-Code-Interpreter.git
```

2. Change directory:
```bash
cd Llama2-Code-Interpreter.git
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

I see, you want to include the part about setting the `LLAMA_CI_PATH` environment variable in the setup instructions. Here's how you might write it:

It looks like you want to modify instructions for running a Gradio app for your GitHub project. I'll rewrite the instructions based on the provided details:

### Run App with GPT4 finetunned Llama Model

To start interacting with Llama2 via the Gradio UI using  `codellama-7b-instruct-pad`, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the Repository (if you haven't already)**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SeungyounShin/Llama2-Code-Interpreter.git
   cd Llama2-Code-Interpreter
   ```

2. **Run the Gradio App**:
   ```bash
   python3 chatbot.py --path Seungyoun/codellama-7b-instruct-pad
   ```

For those who want to use other models:

### General Instructions to Run App

To start interacting with Llama2 via the Gradio UI using other models:

1. **Run the Command**:
   ```bash
   python3 chatbot.py --model_path <your-model-path>
   ```

Replace `<your-model-path>` with the path to the model file you wish to use. A recommended model for chat interactions is `meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat`.
